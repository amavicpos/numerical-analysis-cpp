# Numerical Analysis in C++
This repository contains a mid-term exam about numerical analysis in C++, targetting root-finding and linear equation systems solver methods.

## Contents
- `exparcial_1.cpp`: C++ source code for the first part of the exam.
- `exparcial_2.cpp`: C++ source code for the second part of the exam.
- `resultados_parcial_1.txt`: Results from the first part of the exam.
- `resultados_parcial_2.txt`: Results from the second part of the exam.
- `Informe_parcial_1.pdf`: Report for the first part of the exam.
- `Informe_parcial_2.pdf`: Report for the second part of the exam.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amavicpos/numerical-analysis-cpp.git
    ```
2. Compile the C++ source files:
    ```bash
